🌍 Imports & Exports Analysis: Unlocking Global Trade Secrets

  What’s the Scoop?
This project dives deep into a hefty dataset of over 300 international import/export transactions across categories like electronics, office gadgets, and home essentials. It’s packed with juicy details — quantities, prices, who’s shipping from where, where it’s headed, and what it costs to get there (both in dollars and days).
